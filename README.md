# Visual Controller Anomalies Detection and Mitigation

## [Project Website](https://phoenixrider12.github.io/failure_mitigation) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13475.pdf)

Here is the codebase for our paper ["Detecting and Mitigating System-Level Anomalies of Vision-Based Controllers"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13475.pdf) for an aircraft taxiing problem. We present a framework for detecting system-level failures using a trained anomaly detector and implementing a fallback mechanism for safety-critical control.
